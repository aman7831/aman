            <p style="text-align: justify">
              I am a Data analyst ! I love untangling data to reveal hidden insights, like solving puzzles with numbers.
              I help companies make smart decisions using this knowledge.I'm always learning new things, but for fun, I travel, play games, read, and watch movies. <br /><br />

              In Excel, I'm like a bloodhound on the trail of information. 
              I use the program's built-in tools to sniff out hidden patterns and trends buried deep within spreadsheets. 
              My secret weapons? Formulas and functions!  These are the keys that unlock insights by cleaning, organizing, 
              and summarizing all that data. I create charts and tables to turn those numbers into clear pictures, 
              making it easy for everyone to understand the story the data is telling.  Basically, I'm a translator, 
              transforming raw information into knowledge that businesses can use to make smarter decisions. <br /><br />
              
              
              In the end, I'm more than just a data analyst; I'm a translator of information.
              I translate numbers into insights, empowering businesses with the knowledge to make smarter decisions.  
              This data detective work unlocks their full potential.

                  Studying BCA at Kathmandu Bernhardt College, 
                  part of Tribhuvan University, gave me a solid background 
                  in computer science. The program covered programming, web development, 
                  and database management. Graduates can pursue careers in software development, 
                  web design, IT consulting, and even start their own tech businesses.
